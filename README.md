Pomodor Timer is space where you can make the best use of your own time. A completely variable alternating timer that makes sure you have the breaks you need while still ensuring you get your work done.
This project is for educational purposes. My main aim is to build a responive Website using HTML, CSS and Javascript.

# User Experience

## Website Goals:
The goal of the website is to make a space where you can work in peace and efficently with sufficent breaks between work time. It also has the ability to allow users to track their tasks so they know exactly what they are doing and what they need to do next.

### User Goals:
- User is able to set timer for their preferred work and break time.
- User can easily add and manage their Tasks that they need to complete.

### Returning User Goals:
- Users have a record of what times they like to use for easier setup.
- Tasks are saved so they always know what needs to be done.

## User Stories:

### As a new user:
* I wish to be able to set timers to be able to clear plan out when I will be working and when I will be taking a break in a given time period.
* I want the ability to note down what tasks I have to do, and have the ability to mark when they are complete and delete them.
### As a returning User
* I want to be able to return to website knowing what tasks I still have left from the previous session.

# Website Structure

## Wireframes
I used the website Figma to create the wireframe.

### Colours
I wanted a clear difference between the colors of the website while it was in work mode and while it was in break mode.
### Fonts

# Features
There were several essential features I wanted for this project. A variable timer being chief among them. Along with the timer, I also wanted a good

## Navigation Bar

I wanted the navigation bar to be simple and easy to use, the name of the website and a settings button was all that I needed to add to provide full functionality of the nav bar. Clicking the settings icon will open up a modal that provides all the options you might need to change the Timer.

## Pomodoro Timer
![Work mode](assets/readme-images/WorkMode.png)
I wanted the timer to be the main feauture for the website, as using one has always been a method of working that has been beneficial for me. Having the ability to set what time you want was also an essential edition.


## Break Mode
![Break Mode](assets/readme-images/breakMode.png)
After work has been complete I want their to be a stark difference between the site whether the timer is being used as a break countdown. The color change to a calming blue and green


## Tasks
![Task List](assets/readme-images/TaskList.png)
The task list is a handy addition to the pomodor timer page. With it you can keep track of any tasks you might have. Keeping the data locally so as long as you don't delete the task it will always stick around.

## Media Changes

## Issues found during site development.
### Input issues with settings in the Safari Browser.

In the Safari browser, number inputs still allowed the user to input other characters. 
To fix this I removed all characters inputted after the button for the timers settings was clicked, along with an alert if the input didn't equal what is required.
